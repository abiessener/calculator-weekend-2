# calculator-weekend-2

## Description
This was a Prime weekend challenge that I had a lot of fun with. The basic idea was to do a dead-simple set of inputs in HTML and use jQuery to display the result of the calculation, but that sounded boring. So I made a whole 'calculator,' with a calculator-like UX. Then I realized I hadn't actually done the basic assignment, so I tacked that on the bottom with some logic to give something approaching a consistent UX across both input paradigms.

## What I Learned
You have to really work to build the terrible UX of a traditional calculator in a web browser, compared to a more flexible, modern set of interactions!

Grid is pretty useful for this sort of thing, and I'm glad I took the time to figure it out at a basic level.

## What's Applicable to Later Projects
I'd say just the time I spent messing around with CSS and Grid is probably the most useful part of this project. There's not really any code here that I'd look to save or port to any later projects.
